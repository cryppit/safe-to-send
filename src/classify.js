// The verdict for sending to one address on one chain, from what every chain says about that address. Pure: the
// facts come from check.js (or a test).
//
// facts = {
//   address, target,                      the address and the chain ID the funds go to
//   chains: { [chainId]: { code, nonce, safe?, token? } },   code "0x" = none, null = could not read
//   abstractWallet,                       the address is in the archive of Abstract Global Wallets
// }
// The answer: { level: "safe" | "caution" | "stop" | "unknown", kind, title, reasons[], recovery, unread[] }, where
// recovery says who could reach funds already sent there: "owner", "maybe", "none", or null when unknown.
